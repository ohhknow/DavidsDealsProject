How we met the requirements:
I believe we met all the requirements. Although we didn't have 10 pages, we didn't want to add pages without providing any value to our website. Our main focus was on functionality and ensuring the store page works properly. Most of our pages are responsive on all screens, except for some forms that don't resize when the window is shrunk. Additionally, we didn't put the PHP files into a separate folder because the database stopped working when we attempted to do so. Other than that, I think we have everything else covered. We utilized grids and flexboxes, implemented a navigation bar, footer, and header. All the content is readable and centered, and we incorporated multiple fonts. Our images are organized into two separate foldersâ€”one for webpage images and another for store images.

One critique:
Our client expressed a desire for us to include categories in the store, such as shoes, glasses, etc. They wanted this to reduce the amount of scrolling required when browsing products.
